1) Create a program named "my_list_store"
which support following operations on list named "members" which is provided by the user 
for ex: ["Pratiksha","Kevin","Sachin","Yuvraj","Sania"] is provided by the user 

Operations supported by our program are :
  1:  Display number of elements in the members list
  2:  Add an element to the members collection like 'Sehwag' 
  3:  Add elements to the members collection like ['David','Bret','Sanju']
  4:  Remove a member from the collection at a given subscript
  5:  Remove the last member from the collection 
  6:  Display third, fourth and fifth element from the collection 

Keep asking the user for the operation in this store untill he chooses to exit from the program

# Sample code template

def list_display_members(members) :
	pass # write your logic

def list_add_element(members) :
	pass # write your logic

def list_add_elements(members):
	pass # write your logic

def list_remove_element(members) :
	pass # write your logic

def remove_last_element(members) :
	pass # write your logic

def display_3_4_5_element(members):
	pass # write your logic

			
def my_list_store():
    print("\n Welcome to Our List Store !!! ")
    print("Please enter a list Comma seperated that you would want to perform Operation Upon")
    members = input('for ex: Pratiksha,Kevin,Sachin,Yuvraj,Sania \n').split(",")

    while(True):
        print("\n*************** Menu **********************")
        print("Operations supported by our program are :")
        print("  1:  Display number of elements in the members list")
        print("  2:  Add an element to the members collection like 'Sehwag' ")
        print("  3:  Add elements to the members collection like ['David','Bret','Sanju']")
        print("  4:  Remove a member from the collection at a given subscript")
        print("  5:  Remove the last member from the collection ")
        print("  6:  Display third, fourth and fifth element from the collection ")
        print("  7: Exit the Program ")
        choice = int(input("Please enter your choice "))
        
        if choice   ==1:
            list_display_members(members) 
        elif choice ==2:
            list_add_element(members) 
        elif choice ==3:
            list_add_elements(members)
        elif choice ==4:
            list_remove_element(members) 
        elif choice ==5:
            remove_last_element(members) 
        elif choice ==6:
            display_3_4_5_element(members) 
        elif choice ==7:
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid Input , Please Try Again !!!!  ")
